//! serialport-rs is a cross-platform serial port library.
//!
//! The goal of this library is to expose a cross-platform and platform-specific API for enumerating
//! and using blocking I/O with serial ports. This library exposes a similar API to that provided
//! by [Qt's `QSerialPort` library](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qserialport.html).
//!
//! # Feature Overview
//!
//! The library has been organized such that there is a high-level `SerialPort` trait that provides
//! a cross-platform API for accessing serial ports. This is the preferred method of interacting
//! with ports and as such is part of the `prelude`. The `open*()` and `available_ports()` functions
//! in the root provide cross-platform functionality.
//!
//! For platform-specific functionaly, this crate is split into a `posix` and `windows` API with
//! corresponding `TTYPort` and `COMPort` structs (that both implement the `SerialPort` trait).
//! Using the platform-specific `open*()` functions will return the platform-specific port object
//! which allows access to platform-specific functionality.
